# History of the models built along the project

1. **model_00.h5**: Build a simple Neural Network with only one fully-connected layer. Used to test the simulator.

2. **model_01.h5**: Build LeNet-5 Neural Network without dropout or regularization techniques. Images has been converted to grayscale, resized to 32x32, and normalized.
